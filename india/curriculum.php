            <p class="description text-center">Our international team of experts has created a comprehensive pedagogy, known as the Kïdo Early Years Program. This innovative system incorporates the best practices from teaching philosophies from around the world, such as Montessori, Reggio Emilia and the theory of Multiple Intelligences. The result is a play-based learning experience that combines child and teacher-led activities with free and structured play in inspirational settings. The program is customised to the developmental ability of each child. We modify our curriculum for each country we operate in, to adhere to their existing national curriculum frameworks. In the UK, the Kïdo curriculum is modified to adhere to the EYFS framework.</p>

Within the room we focus on your child’s personal, social and emotional development, ensuring secure attachments with their key person and peers is fundamental to a child's ability to thrive within nursery life. Our highly skilled practitioners provide children with a range of age and stage appropriate activities to challenge their educational development, with particular focus on language development and physical development. The children enjoy free and guided play, art and music and messy play. Practitioners will work closely with parents and carers to follow nap and food schedules and ensure a smooth transition from home to nursery and vice versa.</p>

The children will benefit from Kido Explorer Days, a child initiated, project based learning day, where through skilled observation practitioners can plan unique activities to stimulate the children's curiosity and desires for knowledge in specific topics. Topics are enhanced by class outings and first hand experiences where possible or through sharing of experiences within the Kido international community. Parent participation is always encouraged should a topic and parents skill set align. During time in the experimenters class children will also be encouraged to participate in Kido STEM classes.
